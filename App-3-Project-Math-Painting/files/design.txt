Title: Math Painting
Description: An app that lets the user provide the start coordinates of geometrical shapes such as
squares and rectangles, their dimensions, and their colors, and the program produces an image file canvas with all
the geometrical shapes drawn in it.
Objects: Square:
            x
            y
            side
            color

Title: Drawing over a canvas
Description: An app that draws shapes on a canvas; like square and rectangle. it takes the square's side length from the user, the width and height of a rectangle. and the starting point for drawing them (coordinates). and then draws them with a special color on a canvas which is either white or black.

Objects:
	Canvas
		width
		height
		color
		make()
	Square
		color
		side length
		x
		y
		draw()
	Rectangle
		color
		width
		height
		x
		y
		draw()
